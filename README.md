# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my first Python project. A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python.
I have divided the project in 2 different files: a functions.py, where I wrote all the functions used, and a second one where the game's logic is established. 
Commentaries may be either in English or Romanian, but in some places there are in both languages.
